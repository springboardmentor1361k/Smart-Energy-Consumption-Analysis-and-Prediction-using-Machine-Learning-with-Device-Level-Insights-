# ⚡ Smart Energy Consumption Analysis & Prediction
### AI/ML-Driven Analysis with Device-Level Insights

**Infosys Springboard Internship Project**

---

## 📖 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and forecast household energy consumption using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. By leveraging a large-scale dataset (2M+ records), we seek to identify consumption patterns, optimize energy usage, and predict future demand at both the global and device level.

### 🎯 Objectives
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning:** Process raw power consumption data.
2. **EDA & Visualization:** Uncover temporal patterns and correlation.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Create robust predictors for ML models.
4. **Forecasting/Modeling:** Predict future energy usage using Regression/LSTM.
