# Smart Energy Consumption Analysis and Prediction  
### Device-Level Insights using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
The rapid increase in electricity demand and the absence of device-level visibility often lead to energy wastage and higher electricity bills. Traditional billing systems provide only aggregate monthly consumption without actionable insights.

This project focuses on **analyzing and forecasting device-level energy consumption** using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. By leveraging time-series data from a smart home energy monitoring dataset, the system provides predictive insights, visual dashboards, and intelligent energy-saving suggestions.
