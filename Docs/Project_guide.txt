Smart Energy Consumption Analysis and Prediction using Machine Learning
________________________________________
Project Overview (Understand Before Coding)
You are building a Smart Energy Consumption Analysis System that:
•	Understands device-level energy usage over time
•	Analyzes historical patterns
•	Predicts future energy consumption
•	Provides insights and energy-saving suggestions
•	Exposes results through a simple web dashboard
This is not just an ML model. It is a full pipeline project:
Data → Cleaning → Features → Models → Evaluation → API → Dashboard → Deployment

WEEK 1 — DATA UNDERSTANDING & EXPLORATION (FOUNDATION WEEK)
Goal of Week 1
Your goal is not modeling. Your goal is to understand the data deeply.
A senior engineer never trains a model without knowing:
•	What each column means
•	How the data is collected
•	Where the data can break
What You Must Do (Step-by-Step)
1.	Define the project scope clearly
o	What is energy consumption?
o	What does “device-level” mean?
o	What are we trying to predict (hourly/daily consumption)?
2.	Load the SmartHome Energy Dataset
o	Check file format (CSV)
o	Inspect number of rows and columns
o	Print first and last few rows
3.	Understand each column
o	Timestamp
o	Device name
o	Power consumption value
o	Units (Watts / kWh)
4.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
o	Plot energy consumption over time
o	Check missing timestamps
o	Identify abnormal spikes
Mentor Notes (Important)
•	Do NOT clean data blindly
•	Write markdown explanations in the notebook
•	Plots should answer questions, not decorate
Week 1 Output
•	Cleanly structured notebook
•	Clear EDA plots
•	Written observations

WEEK 2 — DATA CLEANING & PREPROCESSING (ENGINEERING DISCIPLINE)
Goal of Week 2
Turn raw data into model-ready data.
Bad preprocessing = bad model (no exceptions).
What You Must Do
1.	Handle Missing Values
o	Missing timestamps → resample
o	Missing readings → interpolation / forward-fill
2.	Outlier Handling
o	Detect abnormal power spikes
o	Decide whether to cap or remove
3.	Time Conversion & Resampling
o	Convert timestamp to datetime
o	Resample to:
	Hourly
	Daily (if needed)
4.	Scaling / Normalization
o	Use MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler
o	Explain why scaling is required
5.	Train–Test Split (Time-Based)
o	Never shuffle time series data
Mentor Notes
•	Always explain why a preprocessing step is used
•	Code without explanation = incomplete work
Week 2 Output
•	Final cleaned dataset
•	Preprocessing pipeline
•	Dataset ready for feature engineering

WEEK 3 — FEATURE ENGINEERING (WHERE ML REALLY BEGINS)
Goal of Week 3
Teach the model patterns, not just values.
What You Must Do
1.	Time-Based Features
o	Hour of day
o	Day of week
o	Month
o	Weekend / weekday
2.	Lag Features
o	Previous hour consumption
o	Previous day consumption
3.	Rolling Statistics
o	Moving averages
o	Rolling standard deviation
4.	Device-Level Aggregations
o	Average consumption per device
o	Peak usage times
Mentor Notes
•	Feature engineering decides model success
•	More features ≠ better features
Week 3 Output
•	Feature matrix (X)
•	Target variable (y)
•	Visual explanation of features

WEEK 4 — BASELINE MODEL (DISCIPLINE WEEK)
Goal of Week 4
Build a simple model to set a performance baseline.
What You Must Do
1.	Implement Linear Regression
2.	Train the model
3.	Evaluate using:
o	MAE
o	RMSE
4.	Visualize Predictions
o	Actual vs Predicted plots
Mentor Notes
•	Never skip baseline models
•	Deep learning without baseline is meaningless
Week 4 Output
•	Baseline model notebook
•	Evaluation metrics
•	Comparison-ready results

WEEK 5 — LSTM MODEL (ADVANCED MODELING)
Goal of Week 5
Learn sequence-based deep learning.
What You Must Do
1.	Prepare sequences for LSTM
2.	Design LSTM architecture
3.	Train model using time windows
4.	Tune hyperparameters
Mentor Notes
•	Understand sequence length
•	Overfitting is common—watch validation loss
Week 5 Output
•	Trained LSTM model
•	Loss curves
•	Saved model
________________________________________
WEEK 6 — MODEL COMPARISON & INTEGRATION
Goal of Week 6
Decide which model is production-ready.
What You Must Do
1.	Compare Linear Regression vs LSTM
2.	Evaluate using:
o	MAE
o	RMSE
o	R²
3.	Select best model
4.	Wrap model for Flask API usage
Mentor Notes
•	Accuracy alone is not enough
•	Stability matters

WEEK 7 — DASHBOARD & INSIGHTS
Goal of Week 7
Convert numbers into user understanding.
What You Must Do
1.	Build visual dashboards
2.	Show trends (hourly/daily/weekly)
3.	Add smart energy-saving suggestions
Mentor Notes
•	Insights should be actionable
________________________________________
WEEK 8 — DEPLOYMENT & FINAL DELIVERY
Goal of Week 8
Deliver like a professional engineer.
What You Must Do
1.	Integrate Flask backend
2.	Connect frontend
3.	Final testing
4.	Clean documentation
5.	Final GitHub push
