Smart Energy Consumption Analysis and Prediction using Machine Learning with
Device-Level Insights
Project Statement:
The increasing demand for electricity and lack of visibility into energy usage patterns often result in
energy wastage, higher electricity bills, and inefficient appliance usage. Traditional billing systems
provide only monthly consumption values without offering meaningful insights into where and how
energy is used. This project proposes a Smart Energy Consumption Analysis System that monitors energy
usage device-wise over time, analyzes energy patterns, and predicts future consumption using machine
learning techniques.
Using the SmartHome Energy Monitoring Dataset with detailed timestamped device-level power
readings collected over six months, the system performs time series analysis and forecasting using Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Linear Regression as a baseline model. It provides users with
interactive visualizations, smart energy-saving suggestions, and a web-based dashboard built using Flask,
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system aims to improve energy efficiency, lower electricity costs, and
support sustainable energy usage behavior.
Outcomes:
• Analyze device-level energy consumption trends with hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly insights.
• Predict future energy consumption using LSTM-based time series forecasting.
• Compare baseline linear regression predictions with LSTM to evaluate performance.
• Provide visualization dashboards using matplotlib and pandas for better user understanding.
• Generate smart suggestions to reduce energy wastage and optimize device usage.
• Deploy an interactive web application using Flask API for real-time energy monitoring.
• Enable integration-ready architecture for future IoT sensor streaming.
• Achieve up to 95% prediction accuracy using deep learning models.
• Provide automated data preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and feature engineering.
• Build a scalable system extendable to anomaly detection and smart home automation.
