Dear Interns,

Please treat the shared colab link as the main reference project document. It is well-structured and clearly written, so make sure to carefully go through it and follow the same approach while refining your work.

Colab Link: 

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1swP-N6rGvqOnWBXT55unLexdN7fk3Wl8?usp=sharing

If anything is missing in your current implementation, update it accordingly. Consolidate everything into one complete Google Colab notebook that includes all work starting from Milestone 1 up to the current stage.

Once completed:

Ensure the notebook is properly structured and clean.

Push the final consolidated notebook to your main branch.

Upload the corresponding documentation as well.

Make sure the project includes complete front-end, back-end, and overall integration.

As per the dashboard requirements, include all relevant visualizations clearly.

You should be prepared to showcase your entire project end-to-end, including implementation and deployment aspects if applicable.

Please ensure you follow these instructions carefully in all future submissions as well.

That’s all for now.

Thank you.

Regards,
Priya
